_"It's a great opportunity, not only to explore sports and the athletic side that we love, but also the opportunity to minister Christ to someone else. It is important that we, as sports medicine professionals, are able to be a light in a dark world to the athletes that we work with." **–**_ **Corey Oshikoya, MS, ATC, CSCS; Loyola University Chicago**

_"Having traveled as a basketball player and now as a physician, I can truly say that AIA is an experience like no other in sports.”_ **– Tom Terrell, MD; Knoxville, Tennessee**

_"God opens doors all the time for us. We just have to be ready and available. I'm thankful to my experiences with Athletes in Action ministering to me so that I can minister to others." **– Cate Ellis, MS, ATC; Quinnipiac University**_

_"Thank you for the chance to travel with AIA. Each trip was filled with professional and personal growth opportunities. I enjoy the opportunities that you and AIA afford me to serve the Lord."_ **– Dennis Hunt, EdD, CSCS; Florida Gulf Coast University**

_"As a student, it was an incredible experience to live in community with other believers, to learn and grow clinically \[from certified athletic trainers\]. It prepared me to see how ministry is wherever you are." **–**_ **Mary Green, MS, ATC; Liberty University**
