quote: â€œGod completely rocked my world through this whole experience....God wanted
  to grow me in ways I could have never imagined. He wanted me to take a step of faith,
  trusting only in Him. I am so glad that I decided to take that step of faith....I
  am completely in awe. God returned me to Himself through this trip......This experience
  is something that came at the right time for me, right after graduating. It has
  shaped my thoughts going forward with my life and career. I am forever grateful
  for this opportunity."
