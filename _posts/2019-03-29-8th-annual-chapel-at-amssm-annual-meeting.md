The eighth annual chapel at the American Society for Sports Medicine will be held at 7:00 am CDT on Sunday, April 14th in the Chambers Room (2nd Level) at the Marriott Marquis in Houston, Texas. 

"Engaging Others with Christ's Love" is the focus of this year's chapel.

Going to Houston? Come hear an intriguing story of how one college basketball player found the Love of God through "whirlpool witnessing."

Not going, but knowing someone who is? Send them a note encouraging them to attend!
