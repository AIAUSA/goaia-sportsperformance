Memorial Day Weekend saw the arrival of AIA’s 2018 summer interns. June and July will provide for them (and the AIA staff leading them) the opportunity for growth, if they’re willing to dive in with all their heart. “This summer I am striving to grow clinically, professionally, spiritually, and in fellowship as I impact people physically while opening hearts spiritually”, said Janell Burkart an AT student from North Dakota State University.  Janell is part of a team of four including Ali Hoffman from Minnesota State University Moorhead, Heather Deal and Cassi Peck from Liberty University. They arrived excited about the summer and eager to serve along with 10 other interns from a variety of departments at Athletes in Action’s headquarters.

Doven Glover (above right), one of the leaders of the 2017 X Project joined staff from Athletes in Action headquarters to welcome the interns to Ohio. “You will grow this summer as you are challenged. If it doesn’t challenge you it won’t change you.” said Glover, a senior at Wright State University, who served as a strength and conditioning intern at AIA. Glover also quoted Brittni Hoover who served AIA’s Sports Complex and Retreat Center during the summer of 2017. Hoover encouraged this year’s interns with a Facebook post stating, “I can’t believe its been a year since I started my internship with AIA. This was the best summer of my life.  These people have become some of my absolutely closest friends. This experience helped to shape me. This experience taught me to be vulnerable in a new way. I was shown how true authenticity is contagious. I saw a group of people become like glue in such a short time. I will forever be so grateful for this scary leap of faith to move to Xenia, OH. I feel so blessed. Here’s to the newbies who are arriving today! I pray that you dive into this experience with everything you have and give your all this summer”.

Lauren Jackson, ATC (Graduate Assistant at Cedarville University) will assist the AIA Sports Performance staff in supervising the summer interns. The next nine weeks will see them exploring how athletic training and strength & conditioning can further missions around the world through the platform of sport. They will assist with AIA baseball games and camps and visiting local sports medicine and strength & conditioning facilities such as Kettering Sports Medicine and Ignition Athletes Performance Group.
