In 2nd Timothy 2:2, Paul exhorts his disciple with these words...“and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.” Words often create indelible memories and lift us up to endure difficult times. These words of encouragement come in both directions in a teaching relationship. We recently received the following note from one of our summer interns as she finished the last days of her nine week internship...

_“Thank you for everything you did for us four strangers this summer. Your wisdom, organization, and ability to handle so many situations has inspired me. Thank you for letting me practice all I’m learning at school, and challenging me to think about the bigger picture of why I do the things I do. I have been so blessed to work under you this summer. Thanks for everything!”_ – Cassi ![](/uploads/Calf-Cramps-1024x683.jpg)

The truth is that we were blessed beyond measure to have the interns we had this summer. They were excited about their walk with the Lord, their chosen profession and serving with AIA. We never had to check behind them to see if something got done that we delegated to them. It was a joy to see them grow in their service to others, their knowledge of athletic training and their faith.  Here are more encouraging words...

_"Never have I experienced a place where a missional mindset is so consistently displayed within the world of sport.”_ – Heather

_“Thank you for being open to discuss how personal life and athletic training collide with a mission field as well. The best experience was the homeless outreach in Cincinnati, it helped me see how anyone could become homeless.”_ – Janell

_"I got the opportunity to pray with a patient while job shadowing, then the man I was shadowing complimented me saying, "Wow, I should really do that more."  It was very encouraging to know that X Project is giving me tools to create space for God in daily life.”_ – Ali

I have an understanding, albeit small, of why I am in the major I am, how I can use it to make a difference for people, how my work really is worship.”_

Our vision for all of our interns is to train and equip them for a lifetime of influence no matter where God takes them in life.  AIA Sports Performance has opportunities for strength coaches, athletic trainers and students in these fields.
