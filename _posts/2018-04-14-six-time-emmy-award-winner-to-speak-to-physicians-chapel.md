     **Six time Emmy Award winning producer for ESPN and former AIA softball player, Lisa Fenn will be the featured speaker at the 7th annual Christian Sports Medicine Association Chapel at the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine’s (AMSSM) annual meeting.** [**This year’s chapel**](http://aiasportsperformance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-Chapel-Invitation-1.pdf) **will be in Kissimmee, Florida on April 29th at 7:00 am. The chapel will be at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort in Pacific A.**

     **Lisa will be sharing how one of the stories she produced for ESPN challenged and grew her faith like no other.  Her feature and resulting memoir, entitled _Carry On: A Story of Resilience, Redemption, and an Unlikely Family_ (Harper Collins), is a touching tale of an unlikely family forged through barriers of race, class, and disability. It serves as an example of how racial and socioeconomic unity are possible when the love of Christ leads the effort. A powerful memoir about grit, love, hope, and faith—and the courage to carry on, even in the most extraordinary circumstances. If you’re attending the AMSSM meeting, be sure to make plans to attend this exciting chapel. If you know someone attending the meeting, please invite them to attend the chapel.**  [**Download this Invitation**](http://aiasportsperformance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-Chapel-Invitation-1.pdf) **and send it to a friend today!**
