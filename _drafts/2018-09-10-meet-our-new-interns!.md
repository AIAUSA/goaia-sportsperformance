We welcomed two new Year-Round Interns to our staff in the last two weeks! Both are certified athletic trainers who are starting their professional careers by seeking a foundation built upon spiritual and leadership development here at AIA. Take a look at our [**Year-Round Internships**](http://aiasportsperformance.org/get-involved/post-graduate-internships/) to see if this is the best option for you. In the meantime, get to know our Interns for this year!

**What do you hope to get out of this internship?**   ...To be trained with more skills on how to disciple athletes and to be able to equip them to grow and disciple others.

**What are your career goals and aspirations?** ...Well this is a difficult question because the career goals I set for myself in the past have been thrown out of the window by God because He has had better plans for me, such as this internship with AIA. So with that said, I do have a passion/desire to work with the Military as an Athletic Trainer one day. But for now I am focused on AIA and see where God takes me from there.

**How did you hear about AIA Sports Performance?** ...Thanks to modern technology I was able to find Athletes in Action through a Google search of “athletic trainer Christian ministry”. Once I heard Sports Performance’s goal is to blend Athletic Training and Ministry I knew right away this is where God was leading me!

**What is your impression after your first two weeks?** ...After the first two weeks I am encouraged and excited because I fully understand the vision of the Sport Performance team! I have also had the chance to meet almost all of the Sport TEAM people which is encouraging because I like them all and can really see myself fitting in with them all!

**What do you hope to get out of this internship?** ...I hope to grow spiritually, to grow as a leader, and to continue to learn and apply engaging the lost through the platform of athletic training/sports.

**What are your career goals and aspirations?** ...I am in the process of figuring this out :) so I don't have a clear answer. But I would love to see if sports psychology would be in my future and how that would look integrated with athletic training and ministry.

**How did you hear about AIA Sports Performance?** ...I first went on an international women's basketball tour to Kenya in 2016...through that trip I heard about the Sports Performance department and applied to work with the X project team. AIA offered a blend of athletic training and ministry that I didn't know existed!

**What is your impression after your first two weeks?** ...I am encouraged to see the work God has done and is going to continue to do through the platform of sports. I am in awe...God is truly at work!

**What would need to take place for you to look back a year from now and say, this was successful?** ...I would count it a success if I stayed faithful and engaged with where the Spirit lead me throughout the year...I want to walk in step with Him in whatever He desires for this internship, but it's easy to get distracted and pulled in other directions...so it will take diligence and focus on His mission.
