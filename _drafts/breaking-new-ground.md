Athletes in Action Sports Performance held its 30th annual fellowship at the National Athletic Trainers' Association annual meeting in Las Vegas, NV earlier this summer. A few days later the inaugural Iron Circle Breakfast was held at the National High School Strength Coaches Association National Convention. 100 coaches and vendors attended the breakfast and 78 signed up to get more information about joining online biweekly Bible study life groups! These efforts minister to professionals and students in sports medicine and strength and conditioning through outreaches at national conventions.

Iron Circle powered by Athletes in Action is a vision to encourage and equip strength coaches so they can engage fruitfully with the athletes, coaches and administrators they work with. The ultimate goal is sharing with others that there is victory beyond competition in relationship with Christ.
