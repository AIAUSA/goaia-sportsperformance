Iron Circle started as an idea of two high school strength coaches.  Seeds were planted in early 2019 with the start of an online bible study with 10 coaches. That number has grown to nearly 50 coaches involved in five online Bible studies after new ground was broken in June at the National High School Strength Coaches Association!  

_Iron Circle, powered by Athletes in Action_ is a vision to encourage and equip strength coaches so they can engage fruitfully with the athletes, coaches and administrators they work with. The goal is to build community. The seeds planted have now grown in fertile soil and the movement is growing. Soon we'll be starting Iron Circle - Ladies! We're also planning to start Iron Circle - College for those working in the college and university setting in 2020.

If you're looking for community so you can pour into others, contact us at [sports performance@athletesinaction.org](mail to: sportsperformance@athletesinaction.org) to find out how you can join an Iron Circle men's or women's group, or help us start Iron Circle-College.
