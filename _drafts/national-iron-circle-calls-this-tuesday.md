Do all the cancellations due to COVID-19 have you dealing with a lot of emotions? Have you seen fellow coaches and athletes struggle to make sense of all this? 

Iron Circle powered by Athletes in Action will host two nationwide video calls on Zoom this Tuesday, April 7th. The one hour calls will be at 6 am EDT and again at 8 pm EDT. You're welcome to join both calls if you want! This is a great time to join Iron Circle and find out what so many others are talking about.  
  
**6:00 am EDT Iron Circle Zoom Video Call:** [**https://cru.zoom.us/j/754404503**](https://cru.zoom.us/j/754404503)  
**8:00 pm EDT Iron Circle Zoom Video Call:** [**https://cru.zoom.us/j/326036426**](https://cru.zoom.us/j/326036426 "https://cru.zoom.us/j/326036426")  
  
We'll dive into the Bible and have a discussion centered around the theme of **_Cancelled is Not Bad with God_**_,_ led by Jeremy Evans. Then we'll break into separate Zoom rooms for prayer. At the end, we'll come back together on the call as one group to make a few announcements and pray for the NHSSCA.  
  
We look forward to seeing you online on Tuesday!   
Strength in His grace,
