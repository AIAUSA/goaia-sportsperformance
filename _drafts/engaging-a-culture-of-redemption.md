The Bible is a story of God revealing Himself to the world through His redemptive power. Recently, three Certified Athletic Trainers and one athletic training student traveled under the banner of Athletes in Action to Cape Town, South Africa. Their goal was to engage with colleagues and students at the University of Western Cape, and while doing so to tell them about God's redemptive story. They taught classes to sports science students, held discussions with faculty and coaches, and led clinics at the university. And while doing so, encountered God's lessons of redemption for themselves as well. The following excerpts are a glimpse into this journey in the words of one of the team members...

Teaching classes helped us make immediate connections, and gave us the opportunity to share the Gospel with students. One of the many encouraging examples of this involves Dillon, an honors student at UWC. Dillon first heard of AIA two years ago, but at the time wasn’t able to get plugged in. When we arrived, Dillon saw our AIA T-shirts and sought us out! He joined us for our team’s devotional time, shared his story, and expressed a desire to get involved as a student leader. His strong faith and desire to grow will make him a strong leader for Christ on campus! I am amazed at how God answered our team’s mission and Dillon’s prayers in this single encounter.
