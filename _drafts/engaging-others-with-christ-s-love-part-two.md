This summer several athletic trainers, strength coaches, team physicians and students in these fields are experiencing missions in their field of expertise as they serve with AIA or a partnering ministry. They're engaging others with Christ's love this summer in places like Ukraine, Honduras, Israel, Puerto Rico, and Kenya! They are also serving in Alabama, California, Colorado, Minnesota and Ohio. Annie Mitchell, ATC was able to share with orphans in Ukraine while traveling with AIA Wrestling.

Paul may be the first AT to ever tape an ankle on the Southern Steps near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This is the likely location of Peters' sermon on Pentecost where the Church originated nearly 2000 years ago!

Payton Lindsey, ATC recently served as the lead AT at AIA's SoCal Ultimate Training Camp. She wrote, "It has been an incredible experience both clinically and spiritually. It was an honor to start off my Athletic training career by serving the Lord and His children!"

Jim Rumelhart, ATC, CSCS led a team of four diverse professionals to Honduras in early June. Despite facing obstacles in their scheduling, they were able to share the love of Christ with coaches, administrators and students at three universities and at the Honduras Olympic Training Center! 

Mike Baria, MD from The Ohio State University made a huge impact on a group of wrestlers visiting the US in April. Jill Rondini, ATC traveled to Portugal with AIA Women's Soccer and other AT's have served at camps and projects in Gulf Shores, AL, Fort Collins, CO, St. Paul, MN, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Students are serving as well. Alaina Brown, Bethany Seman, Savannah Claire Morgan are in Ohio as summer interns with AIA being mentored by Lisa Martin, ATC and Priscilla Medina, ATC

Several more professionals and students are changing lives and seeing their own life changed through these opportunities! There is still one more international team looking for an AT to serve in August.
