The eighth annual chapel at the American Society for Sports Medicine will be held on Sunday, April 14th at the Marriott Marquis in Houston, Texas. The focus of this year's chapel will be, "Engaging Others with Christ's Love." 

Going to Houston? Come hear an intriguing story of how one college basketball player found the Love of God through "whirlpool witnessing." 

Not going, but knowing someone who is? Send them a note encouraging them to attend.
