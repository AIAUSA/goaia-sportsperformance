**“I came here for sport, encountered Jesus and a new way of life!” Those were the words of Henri, a basketball coach from Cameroon who attended our fourth International Sports Performance     Academy. The Academy is held in conjunction with the larger International Basketball Academy. It lasts twelve days in early November but the results will last for eternity.** 

 

     **Paul picked up Henri up early on a Sunday morning after his all night bus ride from Milwaukee.   After breakfast with Donna and settling into our dorms, Paul gave him the option of resting or coming with us to church. “If I rest now I won’t sleep later, said Henri, and I want to discover your church.” Henri speaks only a little English, so Paul found an online French Bible on his phone for him to read the Scriptures our Pastor taught. Henri told us something awoke in him during our church service. He later told our Pastor that there was a spirit in the people and he worship he had never felt before.** 

 

     **On Monday morning, Henri attended a talk on how to share your faith. The session, led by Lisa Martin who works with Paul, was intended for believers as part of an Equipped Discipleship series they could attend during the Academy. The goal is to send these influential coaches back to their country ready to impact others. Henri knew about Christianity but no one had ever clearly explained the gospel to him until that day. His translator, Magloire (AIA staff in Togo) was led to take him aside after the session to go through the gospel in his mother tongue of French. Henri encountered Jesus through this series of events, starting with church, and ending with listening to Lisa and Magloire. Given the opportunity to pray to ask Jesus into his life, Henri responded with an enthusiastic yes!**
