    on competition as well.&nbsp;If you are looking for an opportunity to use your
    passion for God, love of sports, and your gifts and abilities to serve the Lord
    in a cutting edge ministry, Athletes in Action Sports Performance may be just
    the place for you!</strong></p><p><strong>To learn more details about serving
