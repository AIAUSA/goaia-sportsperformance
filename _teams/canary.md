This team will call the island of Tenerife home for two weeks while on project. The main objective will be renewing friendships and initiating new relationships with the club athletes and coaches within the Canary Track Federation. There is a great need for athletes and coaches who can provide specific technique training in the field events and hurdles, but all event expertise is highly regarded and welcomed.
