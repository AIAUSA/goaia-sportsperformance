TUFF Camp began in 1990 with the goal to create an environment where young athletes learn how to train physically, mentally, and spiritually. As collegiate staff you will mentor high school runners and share with them how you have matured athletically, as as spiritually. The staff team will meet a couple days prior to the start date at our home base in Ohio. We will then spend the remainder of our time in Holland, Michigan on the campus of Hope College.
