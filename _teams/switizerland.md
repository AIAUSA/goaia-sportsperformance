The town of St. Moritz hosted the Winter Olympics in 1928 & 1948 and sits at 6000' elevation. It is a preferred training destination for elite athletes from around Europe. AIA Switzerland hosts an athlete resource center providing physical therapy and massage therapy services. Our team's focus will be building relationships as we train alongside the athletes in St. Moritz. There will be 1 or 2 opportunities to compete during the project, but our primary emphasis will be on training.
