  #### Join 50+ student-athletes and staff from around the country living in community in one huge house for three life-changing weeks. The UP-LA is a one of a kind opportunity.

  Connect with God’s view of sport and competition through the AIA Principles and The SPECIAL. Partner with urban ministry veterans serving "at-promise" communities of LA. Tackle issues of racism, power, class, culture, poverty, privilege, responsibility, social justice, and what the Gospel of Christ has to say about these ever-relevant and important issues.

  An **Athletic Training Student** is needed to assist with this project.

  A **Certified Athletic Trainer** is needed for the athletes’ healthcare needs during the first week with the option of serving during the entire project.
