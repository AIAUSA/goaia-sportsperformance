  of a kind opportunity.** \n\nConnect with God’s view of sport and competition through
  the AIA Principles and The SPECIAL. Partner with urban ministry veterans serving
  “at-promise” communities of LA. Tackle issues of racism, power, class, culture,
  poverty, privilege, responsibility, social justice, and what the Gospel of Christ
  has to say about these ever-relevant and important issues.\n\n* A **Certified Athletic
  Trainer** is needed for the athletes’ healthcare needs during the first week with
  the option of serving during the entire project.\n* An **Athletic Training Student**
