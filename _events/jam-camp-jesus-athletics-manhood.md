  The athletic agenda will be **intensive**, but so will the **spiritual training**. Daily activities include workouts, chalk talks, team-building, sports performance training and competition. “Our camp staff team – from Athletes in Action (AIA) and Cru Inner City – believes that young men involved in sports can become positive leaders and influence generations to come – especially young men who know God,” said John Oliver, JAM Camp Volunteer Director.
