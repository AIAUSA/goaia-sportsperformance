  ## Are you are looking for an opportunity to use your passion for God, love of sports, and your gifts and abilities as an **_Athletic Trainer_** to serve the Lord during AIA's Ultimate Training Camp?

  We're looking for leaders who want to impact others while directing our athletic training coverage at each Ultimate Training Camp (UTC). If you are an AT and feel called to get more involved in ministry we would love to talk with you.

  * Lead AT Team Bible Study small group discussions during the UTC and follow up with the team after the camp.
  * Give leadership to a team of ATâ€™s and AT Students providing athletic training coverage at an Ultimate Training Camp.

  Each Ultimate Training Camp is designed to teach athletes how to apply Biblical principles to their athletic competition. At the conclusion of the camp there is an event called the SPECIAL, which is designed to push the athletes to their physical limits. As a result there is a need for athletic trainers to cover this camp.

  #### Time commitment would include:

  * Training in AIA ministry materials
  * Monthly conference calls for equipping and planning
  * Assisting with recruiting, supply ordering
  * Raise own financial support for salary, travel costs, ministry training, etc.

  **Impact the lives of high school, college, or even professional athletes**

  #### **If you interested in using your skills and knowledge to help change the world by sharing the love of Jesus Christ through Athletic Training...**

  #### **Then, AIA Ultimate Training Camp may be just the place for you!**
