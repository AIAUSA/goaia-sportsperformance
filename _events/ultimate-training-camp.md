  #### Use Your Skills, Learn Biblical Principles, Share Your Faith! Why not join AIA Sports Performance on an adventure in your field of expertise. Let us encourage you in your faith journey at The Ultimate Training Camp!

  The UTC (Ultimate Training Camp) is a high intensity sports camp for athletes. We tackle the issue of how to blend faith and sport together on the field of competition. We teach five Biblical Principles to athletes and then allow them to test those truths in a 20-hour sports marathon known as The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. As a result there is a need for athletic trainers and students to cover this camp.

  A maximum of four **Certified Athletic Trainers** and four **Athletic Training Students** are needed to assist with each weekâ€™s experience.

  **Certified Athletic Trainers and Athletic Training Students** will enjoy small group discussions as a sports medicine team as we explore how these Principles impact our lives, careers and service to athletes. If you're interested in serving as the Head AT at a UTC, take a look at our [Athletic Trainer Part-Time](https://goaia.org/sportsperformance/get-involved/staff) role.

  Our goal is to help every athletic trainer in the nation understand how the gospel impacts their sport and life.
