description: '<p><strong>This camp is designed to teach athletes how to apply Biblical
  principles to their athletic competition.  At the conclusion of the camp there is
  an event called the SPECIAL, which is designed to push the athletes to their physical
  limits.</strong> <br /><br />As a result there is a need for athletic trainers and/or
  MD’s to cover this camp.  <strong>A maximum of</strong> <a href="http://aiasportsperformance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2018-UTC-SP-Recruiting-Flyer.pdf"><strong>four
  Certified Athletic Trainers and four Athletic Training Students </strong></a>are
  needed to assist with each week’s experience.  <br />A newly created <a href="http://aiasportsperformance.org/2017/12/new-opportunity-for-ats-at-ultimate-training-camps/">Head
  AT</a> position is available at each Camp. The AT team will listen to the Principles
  teaching and break into a small group to discuss how they relate to Athletic Training–their
  lives and careers.<br /><br />2019 Dates:'
