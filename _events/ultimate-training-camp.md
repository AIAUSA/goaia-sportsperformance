description: "#### Use Your Skills, Learn Biblical Principles, Share Your Faith! Why
  not join AIA Sports Performance on an adventure in your field of expertise. Let
  us encourage you in your faith journey at The Ultimate Training Camp! \n\nThe UTC
  (Ultimate Training Camp) is a high intensity sports camp for athletes. We tackle
  the issue of how to blend faith and sport together on the field of competition.
  We teach five Biblical Principles to athletes and then allow them to test those
  truths in a 20-hour sports marathon known as The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. As a result there
  is a need for athletic trainers and students to cover this camp. \n\nA maximum of
  four **Certified Athletic Trainers** and four **Athletic Training Students** are
  needed to assist with each weekâ€™s experience.\n\nAs an **Athletic Training Student**
  you will enjoy small group discussions with the sports medicine team as we explore
  how these Principles impact our lives and service to athletes. \n\nAs a **Certified
  Athletic Trainer** you will be given leadership over a team of AT's at UTC. You
  will be trained in AIA ministry materials, to then be able to lead your team of
  AT's through Bible Study small group discussions.\n\nOur goal is to help every athletic
  trainer in the nation understand how the gospel impacts their sport and life. \n\n#####
