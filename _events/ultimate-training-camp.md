  not join AIA Sports Performance on an adventure in your field of expertise. Let
  us encourage you in your faith journey at The Ultimate Training Camp!\n\nThe UTC
  (Ultimate Training Camp) is a high intensity sports camp for athletes. We tackle
  the issue of how to blend faith and sport together on the field of competition.
  We teach five Biblical Principles to athletes and then allow them to test those
  truths in a 20-hour sports marathon known as The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. As a result there
  is a need for athletic trainers and students to cover this camp.\n\nA maximum of
  four **Certified Athletic Trainers** and four **Athletic Training Students** are
  needed to assist with each weekâ€™s experience.\n\n**Certified Athletic Trainers and
  Athletic Training Students** will enjoy small group discussions as a sports medicine
  team as we explore how these Principles impact our lives, careers and service to
  athletes. If you're interested in serving as the Head AT at a UTC, take a look at
  our [Athletic Trainer Part-Time](https://goaia.org/sportsperformance/get-involved/staff)
  role.\n\nOur goal is to help every athletic trainer in the nation understand how
  the gospel impacts their sport and life.\n\n**2021 Dates: UTC is a hybrid (virtual/in-person)
  event this year in multiple locations. The activities have been adjusted so no AT's
  will be needed this year. Check back later for dates for the 2022 UTC in the following
  locations!**\n\n* Ohio: \n* Colorado: \n* Minnesota: \n* Southern California: \n\n####
