<p>  <strong>God is using athletic trainers, strength coaches and students like you to make a difference in athletic departments and on campuses across the country. Do you have a desire to share the Gospel with your teammates or fellow staff, start a Bible study, or do outreaches on your campus? If so, SportLinc is the connection you need.</strong></p>
<p>  SportLinc is an opportunity to be resourced, and poured into as a leader to help start an Athletes in Action ministry on your campus. We want to help equip you to start a movement within your athletic department.  </p>
