    of AIA Sports Performance</strong></p><p>Athletes in Action was founded in 1966
    and quickly entered the world of Sports Performance. AIA founder, Dave Hannah;
    World Champion &amp; 2-time Olympian Russ Knipp, and Wes Neal made up the first
    weight lifting team touring the United States annually from 1969 until 1976. Their
    impact was widespread among college and high school campuses and the United States
    Military. Wes Neal went on to develop “Making An Athlete of God”, the forerunner
    to the AIA Athletic Principles.</p><p>Today, AIA Sports Performance impacts professionals
    and students in sports medicine and strength &amp; conditioning with a vision
    to see a Christ follower in every sports medicine and strength &amp; conditioning
    facility in the world! To fulfill this vision professional and student volunteers
    are recruited to serve on over 40 competitive and educational projects annually,
    while outreaches are held at professional meetings, and individual and group Bible
    studies are being organized. Discipleship materials have been written specifically
    for professionals and students in these fields. A variety of internship opportunities
    have been developed for students and young professionals seeking to establish
    a spiritual foundation to their careers. Professionals and students in a variety
    of sports performance fields impact every sport in every nation every day. By
    meeting the physical needs of those they serve, they will have excellent opportunities
    to meet others’ spiritual needs as well.&nbsp;<a href="http://sportsperformance.goaia.org/uploads/AIA-Sports-Performance-History-Web-Version-revised-7-20-18.pdf">Read
