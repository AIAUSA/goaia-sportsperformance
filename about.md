**History of AIA Sports Performance**

Athletes in Action was founded in 1966 and quickly entered the world of Sports Performance. AIA founder, Dave Hannah; World Champion & 2-time Olympian Russ Knipp, and Wes Neal made up the first weight lifting team touring the United States annually from 1969 until 1976. Their impact was widespread among college and high school campuses and the United States Military. Wes Neal went on to develop “Making An Athlete of God”, the forerunner to the AIA Athletic Principles.

Today, AIA Sports Performance impacts professionals and students in sports medicine and strength & conditioning with a vision to see a Christ follower in every sports medicine and strength & conditioning facility in the world! To fulfill this vision professional and student volunteers are recruited to serve on over 40 competitive and educational projects annually, while outreaches are held at professional meetings, and individual and group Bible studies are being organized. Discipleship materials have been written specifically for professionals and students in these fields. A variety of internship opportunities have been developed for students and young professionals seeking to establish a spiritual foundation to their careers. Professionals and students in a variety of sports performance fields impact every sport in every nation every day. By meeting the physical needs of those they serve, they will have excellent opportunities to meet others’ spiritual needs as well.
