**History of AIA Sports Performance**

Athletes in Action was founded in 1966 and quickly entered the world of Sports Performance. AIA founder, Dave Hannah; World Champion & 2-time Olympian Russ Knipp, and Wes Neal made up the first weight lifting team touring the United States annually from 1969 until 1976. Their impact was widespread among college and high school campuses and the United States Military. Wes Neal went on to develop “Making An Athlete of God”, the forerunner to the AIA Athletic Principles.   

Today, AIA Sports Performance impacts professionals and students in sports medicine and strength & conditioning with a vision to see a Christ follower in every sports medicine and strength & conditioning facility in the world! Our staff aims to fulfill this vision through outreaches at professional meetings, recruiting volunteers to experience missions in their field of expertise, and Bible studies using discipleship materials written specifically for those in these fields. Since professionals and students in these fields impact every sport in every nation every day, by meeting their physical needs, they will have excellent opportunities to meet others’ spiritual needs as well.
