_A man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. Mary would later pour perfume on the Lord. She would also wipe his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was sick in bed. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus. "Lord," they told him, "the one you love is sick." …_

_After he said this, Jesus went on speaking to them. "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep," he said. "But I am going there to wake him up."_

_His disciples replied, "Lord, if he's sleeping, he will get better." Jesus had been speaking about the death of Lazarus. But his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead. For your benefit, I am glad I was not there. Now you will believe. But let us go to him." …_

_Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even if he dies. And those who live and believe in me will never die. Do you believe this?" (John 11:1–3, 11–15, 25, 26 NIRV)_

You’re probably familiar with a young lady named Resusci-Anne. Like me, you met her when you took your first cardiopulmonary resuscitation class. A mannequin developed in 1960 by a Norwegian toymaker named Åsmund Laerdal (yes, that’s THE Laerdal, now the name of an international emergency healthcare equipment company*) and a couple of physicians, the first, and probably the only, words millions of people have said to her are, “Annie! Annie! Are you OK?” And this while shaking her to get her attention! Why? Because appearances sometimes are deceiving, so it's crucial that a rescuer tell the difference between someone who is really dead and someone who is alive. Annie provides the opportunity to practice this skill.

Dead or alive. The question of the day is, are you really dead, do you just look and act dead, or are you fully alive? If you are in the first category, I can’t help you. Of course, being a member of the third category is the goal; but, too many Christians—gloomy and uninspired—fall into the second category because they have let life slip away from them. However, life doesn't just come from Jesus, it IS Jesus. Read the rest of John 11 and you’ll see that Mary, Martha, and Lazarus found that out. I hope you have found that out, too, without having to do so the way they did.

“I am the resurrection and the life,” Jesus proclaimed. He is the one who resuscitates us to live a life for Him. “My friend! My friend! Are you OK?” Live like it today.
